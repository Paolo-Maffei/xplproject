.:| 1.5 |:.
* fixed recognition of block condition if value attribute present but empty
* the order of wildcards was reversed?!... should be fixed now

.:| 1.4 |:.
* new mail adress alicebot@seznam.cz (!)
* fixed whitespace handling on 2 succesive tags (thanks to Dirk Scheuring)
* tweaked the graphmaster, now stores different contexts in different subnodes
  - this should allow for the easier introduction of dynamic path matching &
  user defined contexts
* added some "developer docs" to the site
* some updates to the readme

.:| 1.3 |:.
* fixed <formal> bug with empty contents
* some small corrections in the states of namegame.aiml
* fixed multiple sentence handling
? Sometimes doesn't reply

.:| 1.2 |:.
* I may use the name "Program P" when referring to PASCALice :-)
* optimizations
  + added functions to aid parsing SkipElememt() and ProcessContents()
    and GetContents
  * modified UElements to use the above
* better <condition> handling (empty <li/> and value="") but still no wildcards
* doesn't crash at startup anymore?
* hopefully better whitespace handling
+ some categories to namegame.aiml (it's turning out to be a bad tempered bot)
+ custom <forget> tag which causes all variables to be cleared (see 
  forget.aiml)
* <that> works like it should, keeping the last bots sentence. Multidimensional
  indexing and deeper history still do not.

.:| 1.1 |:.
* fixed exception on empty input (thanks to adwin)
* UPatternMatcher:
  + comments
  - commented out some unused methods
+ this file

.:| 1.0 |:.
