TMoon  (Version 2.0 of 2001-07-07)

This is a collection of some functions to calculate the phases of the moon and
some connected data. To make this a nice Delphi component there's also a
TImage descendent which shows the phase of the moon at a given date.

For the quick use: move the files into your component path and
include it with the file moon_reg.pas in your library. You can then just drop
it onto your forms.

This component is Public Domain. If you like it you can send me a thank you
on a nice postcard from your hometown, but if you really want to send me
money I won't complain :-) , but count it as a gift not a payment. If you use
this component in one of your projects I'd appreciate it if you mention me
somewhere. Only spread this component complete with all the readme's and
sources.

For documentation, contact information etc. read the help file supplied with
the component.

Have fun,
  Andreas H"orstemeier
