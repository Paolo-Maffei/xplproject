The xPL Project has been running since 2003, developing ‘glue’ to tie together home automation technologies.

We have developed a broad range of software and solutions across all of the common operating systems – we have Java and Perl based tools which run on Linux, Windows, MacOS, as well as native applications for Linux and Windows… all sending and receiving a common language of simple XML like text messages.
